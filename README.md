# Sagemath.org Website[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sagemath/website.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sagemath/website)


The `src` contains the sources for the files,
they are rendered to fill-in the blanks for the templates
and the output is placed into `www`.

There are various support scripts for processing the data sources
and a `makefile` to help working with it.

Getting Started
---------------

Make sure to not only clone from here or your fork,
but also to initialize all
[submodules](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Submodules).

    git clone --recursive git@github.com:sagemath/website.git

or if you forgot the `--recursive` switch, do this:

    git submodule update --init --recursive

Later, don't forget to not only update the `website` project,
but also the submodules
(or whatever it is the right thing to do).
For example:

    git submodule foreach "git checkout master; git pull origin master"

Development
-----------

The websites needs various data-sources to build its pages.
For example, the publications pages use HTML snippets
generated by the `publications` submodule.

Ideally, a courageous `make` should do everything for you
and and additional `make open` opens up your web-browser
to inspect the result.

To test the website under realistic conditions,
`make server` starts a minimal HTTP server on port 8181 and
`make show` opens it in your web-browser.

### NQ8 Images

Shrinking PNG images further down via e.g.

### Continuous Build Mode

For your convenience, there is a continuous build mode available: `make cont`

It depends on

* [pyInotify](https://github.com/seb-m/pyinotify) - `pip install --user pyinotify` -
  to pick up any changes in your local file-system.

* [xdotool](http://www.semicomplete.com/projects/xdotool/) - `apt-get install xdotool` -
  which does reload the open tab in your web-browser (by sending `Shift+Ctrl+R`).

Their combined effect is, that less than a second after you "save" a file,
you can see the result without lifting a finger.

Style
-----

* HTML: Modern HTML5, but nothing too fancy please.
  One of the main design goals is that everything should still work
  without Javascript and no Flash.

* Python: PEP8 is authoritative for various Python scripts -- except E501 (long lines).
  Just make sure your `pep8` and `autopep8` is up-to-date and
  do a healthy `make style` to clean up your code before you commit.
