  <h1>One-Sided Limits</h1>
  <p>
  Our topic of discussion in this section is <strong>one-sided limits</strong>,
  which builds upon the preceding lesson on continuity. Create a new worksheet
  called 03-One-Sided Limits. The basis of one-sided limits is that when a function
  jumps suddenly from one value to another, it often is not possible to describe
  the function's behavior with a single limit. What we can do, though, is to
  describe the function's behavior <em>from the right</em> and <em>from the left</em>
  using two limits. Consider the following graph, the code of which is provided:

<pre class="tutcode">
p1 = plot(-x^2+6, x, 0, 2)
p2 = plot(x-1, x, 2, 4)
pt1 = point((0, 6), rgbcolor='black', pointsize=30)
pt2 = point((2, 2), rgbcolor='white', pointsize=30, faceted=True)
pt3 = point((2, 1), rgbcolor='black', pointsize=30)
pt4 = point((4, 3), rgbcolor='black', pointsize=30)
(p1+p2+pt1+pt2+pt3+pt4).show(xmin=0, xmax=4, ymin=0, ymax=6)
</pre>

  1-2) Plot -x<sup>2</sup>+6 from 0 to 2, x-1 from 2 to 4<br />
  3-6) Create three closed points, one open<br />
  7) Combine the plots and points, then show the result with the given x and y boundaries

  The above function has a discontinuity at x=2, and since the two pieces of the
  function approach different values:
  </p>
  <div class="proof">

  You probably see where this is going. What we <em>can</em> say that the limit of
  f(x) as x approaches 2 from the left is 2, and the limit of f(x) as x approaches
  2 from the right is 1. If you were to write this, it would look like:
  </p>
  <div class="proof">
  <img src="calctut-pix/onesided03.png" class="vmiddle" /> and <img src="calctut-pix/onesided04.png" class="vmiddle" />
  </div>
  <p>
  The minus sign indicates "from the left", and the plus sign indicates "from the
  right". Since the limit of f(x) as x approaches 2 from the right is equal to f(2),
  f(x) is said to be <em>continuous from the right at 2</em>. The limit of f(x)
  as x approaches 2 from the left does not equal f(2), however, so f(x) is not
  continuous from the left at 2.
  </p>
  <p>
  One-sided limits are usually fairly straightforward. However, be aware
  that when a function approaches a <strong>vertical asymptote</strong>, such as
  at x=0 in the following graph, you would describe the limit of the function as
  approaching -oo or oo, depending on the case. A vertical asymptote is an x-value
  of a function at which one or both sides approach infinity or negative infinity.

plot(1/x, x, -6, 6, randomize=False).show(ymin=-5, ymax=5, xmin=-5, xmax=5)

  1) Plot 1/x from -6 to 6. randomize=False produces a more consistent result when
  this particular function is plotted.
  </p>

  Here, we would say that the limit of f(x) as x approaches zero from the left is
  negative infinity and that the limit of f(x) as x approaches zero from the right
  is infinity. The limit of f(x) as x approaches zero is undefined, since both
  sides approach different values. Visually,

  <h2>Practice Problems</h2>
  <div id="practice">
  Refer to the following graph of f.<br />
  (a) At which points is f discontinuous?<br />
  (b) For each of these points, determine whether f(x) is continuous from the right,
  from the left, or neither.<br />
  (c) Classify any points of discontinuity as either removable or nonremovable.<br />
