  <h1>Publications Citing Sage-Combinat</h1>

<div class="normal justify bodypadding">
<a href="http://combinat.sagemath.org">{{ sage }}-Combinat</a> is a software
project whose mission statement is: to improve the open source
mathematical system {{ sage }} as an extensible toolbox for computer
exploration in algebraic combinatorics, and foster code sharing
between researchers in this area. Sage-Combinat was formerly known as
MuPAD-Combinat. See also the list of publications citing
<a href="./library-publications-mupad.html">MuPAD-Combinat</a>.
<p/>
Below is a list of publications that cite the algebraic combinatorics
framework developed by the Sage-Combinat team. This list is also available
in <a href="./files/Sage-Combinat.bib">BibTeX</a>
format. The  publications listed in each section are sorted in
chronological order. Where two or more items are published in the same
year, these items are sorted alphabetically by the authors' last names.

      If you use Sage-Combinat in a book, paper, website, etc., please
      Email the <a href="../contact.html">webmaster</a> and the

      Also, be sure to find out which components of {{ sage }}, e.g. NumPy,
      PARI, GAP, that your calculation uses and properly attribute
      those systems. If you are unsure, ask on the
      <a href=
      "http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support">sage-support</a>
      mailing list. Similarly, consider finding out who wrote the {{ sage }}
      code you are using and acknowledge them explicitly as well.
