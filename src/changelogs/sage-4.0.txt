#5546: Closed due to #5777 and #5390: jacobian fails for pynac expressions
rc1: #6130: Mike Hansen: README about documentation is outdated. [Reviewed by William Stein]
CHECK THIS: #5977: Craig Citro: Implement sage -clean-residues [Reviewed by Mike Hansen]
#5909: Closed due to #5930: symbolics -- x.subs_expr({}) hangs sage
