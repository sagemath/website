For details see the Sage 3.0 Release Tour at

  http://wiki.sagemath.org/sage-3.0

* Known Issues with 3.0:

 #2983: Singular interface problems in matrix_group.py on 
        Itanium/Linux: We see a segfault in the doctest and 
        will hopefully fix this in 3.0.1.
 #2985: rubik.py's OptimalSolver() problem on Itanium/Linux: 
        the doctest also segfaults with the "-long" option. 
        This will hopefully be fixed in 3.0.1.

* Bug Statistics

We closed a record number of 277 tickets. For details see

   http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/milestone/sage-3.0

or check out the closed ticket section at the end of the 
announcement. 

* Upcoming Releases

The next release will be 3.0.1, chaired by Michael Abshoff. 
The release is planned in about a week. It will be mostly a 
bug fix release to clear up issues from the 3.0 release.

* Doctesting Coverage

For 2.11 we had:

Overall weighted coverage score:  48.9%
Total number of functions:  18853

We increased coverage by 2.6% in 3.0 while adding 661 functions:

Overall weighted coverage score:  51.5%
Total number of functions:  19514
