<h1>CoCalc</h1>

<div>
There is
<a href="https://cocalc.com/">an online service</a>
for running {{ sage }} computations online.
It has been redesigned from the ground up to be much more reliable,
sustain higher load and offer a lot more features.
It can be considered as the successor of the no longer existing "SageNB" online service.
</div>

<h2>Start</h2>
<ul style="font-size: 120%">
<li><b><a href="https://cocalc.com/">CoCalc: collaborative calculation in the cloud</a></b><br/>
    You can import *.sws worksheet files or work with Jupyter Notebooks (select the "SageMath" kernel).
    </li>
<li>Read the <b><a href="https://doc.cocalc.com/">CoCalc Manual</a></b><br/>
    to learn more about what you can do and how to use it for teaching a class.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Chrome Extension</h2>
<div>Install the
<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cocalc/eocdndagganmilahaiclppjigemcinmb">Chrome Extension for CoCalc</a>.
</div>

<h2>Existing Files</h2>
<div>
To transfer existing *.sws files to the new CoCalc service,
download the notebook files from your current SageNB setup and upload them into a new project on CoCalc.
When you open them, they'll be converted to SageWorksheets.
